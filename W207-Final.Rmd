## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
hist(data$SalePrice)
newData
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
lmMod <- lm(SalePrice ~ . , data = newData)
selectedMod <- step(lmMod, trace = FALSE, direction = "both")
summary(selectedMod)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pval <- 0.05
# summary(selectedMod)$coefficients[,4]
bonf.corrected <-  0.05/length(summary(selectedMod)$coefficients[,4] )
add.in.model <- summary(selectedMod)$coefficients[,4] < bonf.corrected 
# add.in.model
# The amount that are TRUE
length(which(add.in.model==TRUE))
which(add.in.model==TRUE)
```
